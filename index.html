 <p> An analysis of vehicle collisions on New York City roads in 2019 and 2020 found that pedestrians were more likely to be injured in traffic crashes in Brooklyn than any other borough.  

   <p> In 2019, there were a total of 10,568 pedestrian injuries reported in each of the five boroughs. Brooklyn was reported to have 2,700 pedestrian injuries, the highest in the city. Overall vehicle collision rates for the city dropped significantly in 2020. However in a second consecutive year, Brooklyn had the most reported pedestrian injuries with 1,780.

 <p>   The maps above highlight the sum of injuries from each Zip Code in New York City in 2019 and 2020, as reported by NYC Open Data. The highest amount from both years came from the same Brooklyn area code, 11212, with 158 injuries in 2019 and 101 in 2020.   


</p> 


 <p> With the COVID-19 pandemic, there were fewer cars on the road during quarantine, and traffic congestion was all but eliminated. However, traffic injuries still persisted throughout Brooklyn. 

 </p>


 <p>

The New York City Department of Transportation website states, "We recognize that deaths and serious injuries in traffic are not inevitable 'accidents,'' but preventable crashes that can be ended through engineering, enforcement, and education. No level of fatality on city streets is inevitable or acceptable." </p> 


 <p>

In response to combating these issues, the city introduced Vision Zero in 2014, an initiative to eliminate death and serious injuries from traffic incidents. </p> 


 <p>

Vision Zero's intention was to completely reshape how the city and residents approach traffic design and safety. The initiative had reports of early success, but city traffic deaths increased again in 2019 and 2020.
 </p>


<p>There have been many groups who blame Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration for the program's downfall, such as Transportation Alternatives, a nonprofit that advocates for safer roads, bike lanes and walkways.

</p> 

<p>The group is attempting to get the New York State legislature to pass the Crash Victim Rights & Safety Act, a package of laws that aim to curb reckless driving and promote the purchase of safer vehicles.
